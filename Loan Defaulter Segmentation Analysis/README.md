# Loan Defaulter Risk Analysis

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the risk of loan defaulters in the banking and financial services industry. By performing exploratory data analysis techniques and applying risk analytics, we aim to identify patterns and factors that affect loan defaults. We will use publicly available data on past loans and borrowers to develop insights that can help minimize lending risks and provide better decision-making in the future.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn


## Methodology

We will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to gain insights into loan defaulter risk analysis. This will include data cleaning, dealing with missing or incomplete data, identifying relationships between variables, and visualizing data using graphs and charts. Once the data is cleaned and processed, we will identify patterns, key performance indicators (KPIs), and other metrics.

We will also apply risk analytics methods to understand the risk of loan defaulters. This includes using statistical models, such as regression analysis and classification models, to identify risk factors and perform predictive analytics. We will use these models to generate insights and develop strategies for minimizing risks.

### The overall methodology for the project will be as follows:

1. Data collection and cleaning
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Feature engineering 
4. Data analytics modeling 
5. Model evaluation 
6. Conclusion and recommendations


## Conclusion

The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers. We aim to achieve this by applying EDA and risk analytics techniques to publicly available data on past loans and borrowers. The insights gained from this analysis can help banks and other financial service providers better understand loan defaults and develop strategies for minimizing these risks in the future.
